# cli-based-application
A Command-Line Interface (CLI) based application in Python allows users to interact with a program through a text interface, typically using a terminal or command prompt. CLI applications are essential for tasks that require automation, quick execution, and direct access to system functions without the overhead of a graphical user interface (GUI).
